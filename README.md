## About me

I've been studying development as a self-taught learner since June 2022, and I'm always eager to learn more.

### Experiences:
- `HTML 5` - *advanced* 
- `CSS 3` - *advanced* 
- `JAVASCRIPT` - *advanced* 
- `TYPESCRIPT` - *advanced* 
- `React` - *median/advanced* 
- `Node` - *basic* 
- `SQL` - *basic*

Right now, I'm more focused on some **FRONTEND** projects, but I'm very interested in eventually mastering the **BACKEND**.

### Languages:
- `Portuguese` - *native*
- `English` - *advanced*

Soon, i'll post some projects and personal projects i'm developing using **ReactJS**.
